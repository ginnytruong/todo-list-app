# README for Local Deployment:

## Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
MySQL installed locally or accessible via a remote server.
.env file set up with your MySQL database credentials.

## Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL

## Future Enhancements:
TypeScript Migration: Convert existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience.
Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
Authentication Layer: Integrate authentication mechanisms to secure user data and interactions.

## Steps to Load the App Locally:
### Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

makefile
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=todoApp123!
DB_DATABASE=new_todo_app
Adjust these values according to your MySQL setup.

### Run the Development Server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

## Access the Application:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the locally deployed application.

## Usage:
Use the application as intended.
Test features and functionalities locally.




README for Deployed Application:
Tech Stack Used:
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Netlify Functions (Serverless Functions), MySQL
Note: Development Stage
This application is currently in development and may undergo significant changes.
Future plans include migrating to TypeScript, adding unit testing, and implementing an authentication layer.
Steps to Access Deployed App:
Access the Deployed Application:

Open your web browser and go to the URL where your application is deployed (e.g., https://your-app-name.netlify.app).
Usage:

Use the application as intended.
Test features and functionalities in the deployed environment.
Troubleshooting:

If there are issues with the deployed application (e.g., data not loading), check the Netlify Functions logs in your Netlify dashboard (Functions > Logs) for any errors.
Ensure that environment variables are correctly set in your Netlify dashboard (Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment).
Future Enhancements:
TypeScript Migration: Convert existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience.
Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
Authentication Layer: Integrate authentication mechanisms to secure user data and interactions.
